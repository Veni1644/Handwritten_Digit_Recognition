# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition

Handwritten digit recognition is a task in machine learning and computer vision where algorithms are trained to identify and classify handwritten digits from images. It's a fundamental problem in pattern recognition and has applications in various fields such as postal automation, banking, and digitizing historical documents.

Typically, the process involves preprocessing the images, extracting features, and then using classification algorithms like neural networks or support vector machines to recognize and classify the digits. It's a challenging problem due to variations in writing styles, different pen pressures, and noise in the images. However, with advancements in deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), significant progress has been made in achieving high accuracy in handwritten digit recognition tasks.
